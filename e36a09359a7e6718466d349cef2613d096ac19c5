      "message": "Metric would work (I have just confirmed that). I was thinking about single metric for all caches e.g. `cache/chroniclemap/caches_without_dedicated_chroniclemap_configuration` and it would show the cumulative number of caches that miss the dedicated config. We would still keep the log entries and describe how to check it in `tuning.md` as it is now. WDYT?",
