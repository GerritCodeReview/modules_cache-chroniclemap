      "message": "@luca I have implemented this, because I thought we could achieve it, however I have to change my mind on this approach.\n \nchronicle-map cache can expand on disk up to `maxBloatFactor` times, which in turns increases the file size on disk: this means the cache file can still overgrow the diskLimit configuration _after_ we checked during gerrit startup.\n\nThe alternative would be to consider the _worst_ case: as in, how much the map will occupy if it was fully blown. Unfortunately we do not know how much a fully blown cache will occupy on disk :/\n\nI am not sure if we can do better than warning the user that diskLimit cannot be honoured.\n\nWhat do you think?",
