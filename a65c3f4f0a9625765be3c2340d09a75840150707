      "message": "Answering to Tony:\n\n1 - Gerrit does not have internal technical documentation: the code changes too quickly and it would be obsolete in a matter of weeks or just days. The code has always implemented that logic but I agree with you it wasn\u0027t explicit in terms of visibility or interface.\n\nThe 3 lines that @Davido added make a lot of sense to me, but they are in the wrong place: they should be in the Gerrit code, so that the H2 cache could benefit from them as well.\n\nCurrently also the intent of that logic is \"hidden\" in the H2 persistent cache implementation and it wasn\u0027t obvious as both Tony and I missed it.",
