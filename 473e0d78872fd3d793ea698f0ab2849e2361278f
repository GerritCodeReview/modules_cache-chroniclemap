      "message": "@luca, @marcin: this has been merged and it is fine, however I think we might be missing some important information.\n\nNot all persisted caches are on necessarily disk (if diskLimit is set to -1) they fallback to in-memory caches.\nThis is the default for change_notes for example[1].\n\nthis means that this ssh command will not find any file on disk to extract information from, however tuning change_notes is crucial.\n\nHow about a follow up change where the SSH command also retrieves information from the in-memory caches?\n\nShould I create an issue for this? WDYT?\n\n\n[1]https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/refs/heads/stable-3.3/java/com/google/gerrit/server/notedb/ChangeNotesCache.java#63\n",
