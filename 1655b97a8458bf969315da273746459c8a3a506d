      "message": "chronicle-map does not support LRU eviction (nor ordering), so LRU-based cache eviction requires a scan of the entire cache in order to find the minimum, which has a linear complexity for each invalidation. so m invalidations this goes to O(m*n), which is quite bad.\n\nPerhaps this is good enough as this is done on a best-effort approach, but perhaps we should be looking at optimizations.\n\nWDYT?",
