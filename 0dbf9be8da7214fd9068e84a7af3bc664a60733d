An) \u003d Sum(A1 ... An)/n \u003d Sum(A1/n ... An/n)_\n\n```suggestion\n    int i \u003d entry.size();\n    for (Map.Entry\u003cKeyWrapper\u003cObject\u003e, TimedValue\u003cObject\u003e\u003e entry : store.entrySet()) {\n      kAvg \u003d kAvg + (serializedKeyLength(cacheName, entry.getKey()) / i;\n      vAvg \u003d vAvg + (serializedValueLength(cacheName, entry.getValue()) / i;\n      progress.update(1);\n    }\n```\n\nAlso note that `kAvg` and `vAvg` needs to be double.",
